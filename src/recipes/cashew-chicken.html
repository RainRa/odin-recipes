      <h1>Thai Cashew Chicken Stir Fry</h1>
      <img src="../assets/images/Mango-Sticky-Rice-1120x732.jpg" width="700" height="400" alt="Mango sticky rice dish">
      <p>Stir fries featuring cashews are a favorite across Asia and the Thai version is one of the best! Unlike Chinese Cashew Chicken which is generous on sauce, the Thai version is a drier style stir fry where the sauce flavour is much more intense. So you don’t need nor do you want a ton of sauce to soak your rice. There’s plenty of flavour coating the stir fry ingredients that stains and flavours the rice when you mix it through.</p>
